# Phased Objects

Phased objects are objects that are only visible when the player is recording. For that to work, just add a "PhasedObject" group to any Node2D.

The node *has to be a Node2D*. If it isn't, there will be a warning in the console saying that a PhasedObject group is not attached to a Node2D.
