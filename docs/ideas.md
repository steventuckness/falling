# Ideas

This document contains random ideas / ramblings that we can keep track of as we are inspired.

## Coats of Paint
* Particle effects
    * Glowing effects (fireflies) / Glowy whisps
    * Water droplets
    * Leaf rustles as player walks (on impact with walking animation)
    * Bugs and little bits floating around in the background
        * When you get near, the bugs disperse
        * Sound design
    * Random jungle sounds
* Visual flare
    * Vines hanging from platforms
    * Sprite skewing when touching vines (create illusion of interactivity)
    * Wood / trunk sprites holding up the platforms
